Alex Gann code review by Aaron Rash

This is one of the shorter libraries I've looked at, but one of the more practical at the same time.

I went back and looked at your assignment-3 to see how it was applied, and I quite like this approach.

Your class can either return an enumerated list of state names (a column), or the values associated with a selected state (a row).
You then use those results to populate the controls on the form. (dynamically in the case of the state row info)
This keeps your code very concise and readable without losing functionality.
Using this as a blueprint, the same logic can be applied to whatever column or row one desires.

I do think this class could use a few more queries, but this is logically sound.

Your code is clear, concise, and useful.
